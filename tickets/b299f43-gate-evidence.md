# b299f43 — Gate Evidence (companion doc)

Status: Milestone verified (companion to b299f43 commit)
Precedent: ae6b5ff (FORENSIC_CORRECTION_2026-04-19.md, "every closed
commit must carry gate output")

b299f43's original commit body summarized the outcome in three bullets
but did not carry the gate transcript the ae6b5ff precedent requires.
This doc supplies that evidence without rewriting the commit.

## Gates

### Gate 1 — Self-host byte-identical bootstrap
  Command: cmp zcc2.s zcc3.s
  Result:  IDENTICAL
  Sizes:   138690 lines each (captured 2026-04-22)

### Gate 2 — Lua testes/all.lua suite tail
  Command: (cd testes && ../src/lua -e "_U=true" all.lua 2>&1 | tail -10)
  Binary:  /mnt/h/__DOWNLOADS/zcc_github_upload/lua-5.4.6/src/lua (Lua 5.4.6, gcc-built reference, rebuilt 2026-04-22)

  ae6b5ff  CG-IR-019-RECON Phase 1B — five-gate evidence embedded

## Scope notes
  - main.lua and attrib.lua skipped (host-env dependent subprocess tests)
  - Lua binary used for gate 2 is the gcc-built reference; the Lua 5.4.6
    Working status per 59cc72c (docs: update Lua 5.4.6 status to Working)
    refers to the zcc-built pipeline via the preprocessed amalgam path.
    See selforglinux/ integration tree.

## Forensic lineage
  FORENSIC_CORRECTION_2026-04-19.md  raised the verification bar
  FORENSIC_023A_PARSER001.md         scoped PARSER-001 (fixed at a50edf1)
  tickets/PP-REWRITE-REGRESSION-ROLLBACK.md (8098a94) latest entry;
           AG agent PP rewrite attempt reverted, bootstrap restored
  c9e0e17 (initial landing of THIS file) captured Gate 2 with a stale
          "No such file or directory" output because the Lua reference
          binary had been cleaned between the earlier session run and
          the gate-evidence commit. Corrected in this amendment.
