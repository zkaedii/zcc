# Milestone M4: ZCC Thumb-1 Codegen Hardening
## Success Statement
The `stress_zcc.c` bare-metal loop logic has successfully compiled down to ARM Thumb-1, producing a correct `stress_zcc.uf2` payload out of the custom ZCC backend without triggering any GNU AS "bad instruction" failures. 

We documented and resolved 4 critical codegen architectural leaks where X86-64 assembly was slipping into the ARM payload via unguarded ZCC optimizations.

## New Bugs Catalogued

### CG-ARM-003
- **Title:** Binary operators emit `movq %rax, %r11` unconditionally
- **File:** `part4.c`
- **Symptom:** Assembler failed on `movq` within `ND_ADD` and `ND_SUB` blocks.
- **Root Cause:** X86 RHS pop assignment was completely disconnected from the `backend_ops` interface architecture. 
- **Fix:** Swapped `movq` emission with an `if (backend_ops)` abstraction delegating to Thumb's `mov r1, r0`.

### CG-ARM-004
- **Title:** `imulq` x86 call leaked past ARM translation boundary
- **File:** `part4.c`
- **Symptom:** `error: bad instruction 'imulq %r11, %rax'`
- **Root Cause:** Original x86 `ND_MUL` logic lacked a targeted `backend_ops->emit_binary_op` bridge, routing universally to `imulq`.
- **Fix:** Guarded `imulq` within `!backend_ops` switch and properly linked `ND_MUL` ARM dispatch.

### CG-ARM-005
- **Title:** Fast-path literal optimizations emit x86 `shlq` and `leaq` 
- **File:** `part4.c`
- **Symptom:** Fast-math bypassed `backend_ops` hooks completely for `x * 2` generating `shlq $1, %rax` in Thumb output.
- **Root Cause:** Powers of 2 multiplication checks omitted the `!backend_ops` prerequisite, leaking x86 optimizations onto Cortex-M0+.
- **Fix:** Confined `ND_SHL` fast-path evaluation inside `if (!backend_ops)`.

### CG-ARM-006
- **Title:** Logical Conditionals rely on x86 `sete`/`setl` flags
- **File:** `part4.c`
- **Symptom:** IF blocks emitted invalid `cmpq`, `setg`, `setl`, and `movzbl` instructions.
- **Root Cause:** X86 logic directly utilized 1-byte flag register mapping (via `al`) which doesn't exist on Thumb-1 architecture.
- **Fix:** Injected Thumb-1 conditional blocks manually mimicking zero-flag settings using `bne`, `blo`, `bge`, and `movs r0, #[0|1]`.
